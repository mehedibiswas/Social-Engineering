### Scarcity
In this technique, an attacker creates a sense of urgency by presenting an opportunity, offer, or resource that appears to be available for a limited time or in limited quantity. The goal is to manipulate the victim into acting quickly—often without taking the time to thoroughly evaluate the situation. By leveraging the fear of missing out, the attacker pressures the target into making impulsive decisions, such as clicking a malicious link or disclosing sensitive information, before fully considering the consequences.

### Social Validation
This technique exploits the human tendency to follow the actions and opinions of others, particularly those of influential or well-known individuals. For example, if a celebrity or public figure reacts positively to a product on an e-commerce platform, their followers may be inclined to trust and purchase the same product, believing it to be credible or high quality. Scammers can take advantage of this behavior by creating fake endorsements or manipulating social engagement to make their fraudulent platform or product appear trustworthy. As a result, individuals may fall victim to scams simply because they are influenced by perceived social approval.

### Phishing
In a phishing attack, the attacker attempts to impersonate a legitimate individual or organization, typically through email or other forms of electronic communication. For instance, a victim may receive an email that appears to be from their bank, claiming that there has been an unauthorized attempt to access their account. The email urges the victim to take immediate action—such as changing their password—by clicking on a provided link. However, the link leads to a fraudulent website controlled by the attacker, which is designed to closely mimic the legitimate site. When the victim enters their login credentials, the attacker captures this sensitive information for malicious purposes.

### Deceptive Relationships
In this type of social engineering attack, the attacker builds trust with the victim by feigning shared interests or emotional connections. For instance, if the victim has a known interest in cats, the attacker may also express enthusiasm for cats to initiate and strengthen a relationship. Over time, the attacker uses this rapport to extract personal information from the victim, such as their place of birth, childhood location, or other seemingly harmless details. This information may later be exploited to answer security questions, bypass authentication mechanisms, or carry out more targeted attacks such as identity theft or account takeover.

### Baiting
Baiting is a type of social engineering attack in which the attacker exploits human curiosity or greed by deliberately leaving a malicious device—such as a USB flash drive—in a public area, such as a university café, train station, or bus. The device is often labeled in a way that entices someone to pick it up and connect it to their computer (e.g., “Confidential,” “Exam Answers,” or “Company Salary Data”). Once connected, the USB device automatically executes malicious code, leading to the compromise of the victim's system. This may result in the installation of malware, unauthorized access, or data theft, often without the victim’s immediate awareness.

### Phone Phishing (Vishing)
Phone phishing, or vishing, is a form of social engineering in which the attacker uses voice communication to deceive the victim, often by impersonating a trusted individual. In this type of attack, the attacker may mimic the voice of someone the victim knows and fabricate a convincing story to solicit sensitive information or financial assistance. For example, the attacker might call the victim using a spoofed or unknown number and claim to be a friend or family member who has lost their wallet and urgently needs money. They then request the victim to transfer funds through mobile banking services such as bKash or Nagad. By leveraging emotional manipulation and urgency, the attacker pressures the victim into complying without verifying the legitimacy of the call.

### Quid Pro Quo
In a quid pro quo attack, the attacker poses as an authorized individual—such as a technical support representative or IT personnel—and offers assistance or a service in exchange for the victim’s cooperation. The attacker informs the victim that there is an issue or vulnerability in their system and provides seemingly helpful instructions to resolve it. However, by following these instructions, the victim unknowingly performs actions that compromise their device, such as disabling security features, installing malicious software, or granting remote access. This type of attack relies on exploiting the victim’s trust and willingness to accept help from someone they believe to be legitimate
